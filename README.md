# Real-Time Decision Pipeline

Production-oriented reference architecture for **real-time, constraint-governed decision systems**.

This repository focuses on **how decisions flow**, not on a single industry or model:
ingest → evaluate → constrain → decide → expose → observe.

This is the backbone that forecasting, optimization, and human governance plug into.
